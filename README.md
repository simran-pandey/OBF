# OBF - Bioinformatics

I was one of the participants for the round 17 of Outreachy wherein I chose to contribute to project Open Bioinformatics Foundation. The Open Bioinformatics Foundation (OBF) was founded in 2001 to provide community and infrastructure support for open-source bioinformatics software projects. While primary community activity centers around the yearly Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC) meeting, we would like to transform the OBF to a year-round community hub for open biology/bioinformatics science. You can read more about it at https://www.open-bio.org/

Internship Tasks
Tasks included designing and implementing a CMS based website for OBF . The tasks were roughly divided into three phases.

Design phase:

Choose a suitable CMS (Content management systemâ€Šâ€”â€Šour preference is WordPress) & explain why this CMS is the right choice if non-wordpress
Work with the OBF board to create basic page design drafts. These can be done in your tool of choice, whether pen & paper sketch, Photoshop/Illustrator/GIMP/Inkscape / other mock tools, or even a nonfunctional HTML/CSS mock if preferred.
Implementation

Once basic design is agreed, implement the design within the chosen CMSâ€™s templating framework.
Migrate content from the old site to the new design.
Stretch goals:

Usability testing on the new site with members of the OBF community.
When I was going through the project list I found this project to be apt for my tech stack and my learning goals. I have already worked extensively with CMS while creating my website www.simranpandey.com. wherein I experimented with different themes, plug-ins, google analytics, adsense etc.

In the past I had created a newsletter, which I did using plain html, I suggested the same to Yochannah(project mentor) and she created an issue to which I contributed. I created the newsletter using html and css. The design which I suggested was a bit eloborate and It took me quite much time to make it ready to use with all the placeholders but the learning which came from it was definitely worth it.

I was a research intern at IIT Bombay under Prof. Anirudha Joshi, wherein I learned how to work on end-to-end development of a project, collaborate with a team. Communicate frequently with the mentor, presenting the findings and lots more which helped me to perform better while working with a team. My research project at IIT Bombay was development of Disambiguation based chording mobile keyboard for which I learned UI/UX development. creating wireframes and mock-ups of the potential design ideas before prototyping.

I felt that all these skills would come handy while working on OBF project.

Experience with this community

I have had a very pleasant experience while working on this project. Though Yochannah was the official mentor of the project, other team members of OBF were generous enough to not only give us feedback on our ideas and contribution but participate in discussions on Gitter OBF group.

Other key highlight which I really appreciated was yochannah giving us detailed feedback about our contributions. I have participated and have contributed in other open source projects too wherein the mentors tells gives us feedback but never redirected us to learning resources which we can refer to, to improve upon our contribution or polish our ideas.

I feel that the there was a certain kind of love and respect for ideas among all the contributors to this project. Contributors wouldnâ€™t shy away from liking or commenting if they liked any particular idea by other contributors.. I was the first contributor to this project and as the number of participants kept increasing I started to feel that I wasnâ€™t good enough and thought multiple times about leaving it in between but the whole experience was rather pleasant with everyone complimenting each other and not appearing as competitive, I decided to get inspired from others and continue contributing hoping to learn rather than to come out as the ultimate winner.

Experience with other communities:

In the past I have contributed to quite a few open source projects namely

Swarachakraâ€Šâ€”â€Šhttps://github.com/IDC-IITBombay/swarachakra-android

Quarkâ€Šâ€”â€ŠOpenGenusâ€Šâ€”â€Šhttps://github.com/OpenGenus/quark

SoCLIâ€Šâ€”â€Šhttps://github.com/gautamkrishnar/socli

AlgoWikiâ€Šâ€”â€Šhttps://github.com/vicky002/AlgoWiki

I started using GitHub in August last year and I would still call myself a newbie here, yet to explore the collaborative features of this platform. Becoming a part of a project community with mentors to guide would definitely be a big boost to my learning experience.

Below is a proposed schedule for accomplishing some important milestones:

PROJECT GOALS

I have roughly divided the project in 5 major tasks

1. Front-end/Wordpress theme development:

â€¢ Working with the OBF board to create basic page design drafts using wireframes and User Interfaces made using Photoshop/Illustrator or pen

& paper sketch in the initial phase for idea validation.

2. Back End- The back end work will happen using the WordPress dashboard.

The work here would involve :

â€¢ managing the siteâ€™s content, community, functionality.

â€¢ Uploading images on the server, making blog posts

â€¢ Migrating content from the old site to the new design.

3. Beta testingâ€Šâ€”â€ŠAs part of the testing, I will perform the following steps

â€¢ Content related materials (spelling, punctuation, etc.)

â€¢ Design related elements (images, fonts, etc.)

â€¢ Web development items ( live URLs, broken links, etc.)

â€¢ Search engine optimization details ( title tags, meta data, etc.)

â€¢ Network administrator areas (hosting, backup system, etc.)

4. Review and Improvements

â€¢ After reviewing the results of testing and consulting with the OBF board member, will make the required changes as per the feedback

â€¢ Review will be followed by adding or removing features and making the site error free

5. Post-launch of the website

â€¢ Will prepare the site for promotion (if required)

â€¢ Preparing to measure website stats.

â€¢ Testing & finding maintenance if and when needed.

â€¢ Creating Backups of the site.

â€¢ Collecting visitorâ€™s feedback.

6. Maintainig project repository and regular documentation

Since documentation is an integral part of the Open Source projects.

â€¢ I will be maintaining the GitHub repository throughout the internship duration

â€¢ Will keep a log book and a maintain a proper documentation

â€¢ Maintaining OBF GitHub repository with proper documentation

Since I love writing about my experiences, I will be blogging throughout my internship duration perhaps writing about my experience or creating tutorials to share my learnings, You can see articles written by my hereâ€Šâ€”â€Š(https://medium.com/@pandeysimran97) ðŸ™‚
